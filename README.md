# Introduction to {reticulate}

Reticulate RStudio and your R code with Python! In this short work-shop we will show you how to configure your system so that you can use Python inside RStudio 
at the repl/console, in a script and inside R Markdown. As well as how to bring Python packages and functions into your R code!
