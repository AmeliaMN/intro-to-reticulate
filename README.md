# Introduction to {reticulate}
- Workshop for R Ladies Baltimore

Reticulate RStudio and your R code with Python! In this short work-shop we will show you how to configure your system so that you can use Python inside RStudio 
at the repl/console, in a script and inside R Markdown. As well as how to bring Python packages and functions into your R code! To do this we will be relying on the {[reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/)} R package.

## Pre-workshop instructions

We will do some setup collectively at the workshop, however, some aspects of setting this up can take some time, so we ask you to do them ahead of time. Please click on the link below for your computer's operating system. If you think this messes with how you have setup your system, feel free to just install the parts you are missing, or just watch the workshop and then later try to setup reticulate on top of your system's setup.

- [Windows](windows.md)
- [Mac OS](macos.md)
- [Ubuntu](ubuntu.md)

## During the workshop

We will talk through these slides: [slides](slides/reticulate-intro.pdf)

And then talk/walk through these remaining setup instructions: [setup-after-installing-python.md](setup-after-installing-python.md)

And then finally, create this document: [python_rmd.Rmd](python_rmd.Rmd)
